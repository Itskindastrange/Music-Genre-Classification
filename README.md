# Music Genre Classification

This project implements a machine learning system for classifying music into different genres using audio features and deep learning techniques.

## Project Structure

- `source.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the music genre classification model
- `Cross Fold.ipynb`: Implementation of cross-validation techniques for model evaluation
- `Project Report.docx`: Detailed project documentation and analysis
